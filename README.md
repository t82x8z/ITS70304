Scenario and Task DescriptionAI means different things to different people. For some, AI is about artificial life-forms that can surpass human intelligence, and for others, almost any data processing technology can be called AI.The popularity of AI in the media is in part due to the fact that people have started using the term when they refer to things that used to be called by other names.Almost anything from statistics and business analytics to manually encoded if-then rules called AI.Intelligence is not a single dimension like temperature (you can compare today's temperature to yesterday's, and tell which one is higher and which is lower). However, in the context of AI, different AI systems cannot be compared on a single axis or dimension in terms of their intelligence.Artificial intelligence is narrow, being able to solve one problem tells us nothing about the ability to solve another, different problem.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used to predict and monitor human sleep patterns and health, offering new ways to detect potential health problems early and improve overall well-being.Part I: Artificial Intelligence principles
1. Artificial Intelligence can be described using the way how human acting and thinking, humanly and rationally. With a table, define these four categories of definition of AI. (4 marks)Part II: Practical SkillsAll human beings need sleep. We spend a third of our lives asleep, and it’s as important as food, water or air to our survival. While scientists are still working to understand the exact nature of sleep and why it’s so important to our well-being, decades of research have made it clear that adequate sleep is vital to our physical and mental health. Among many other things, sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation and other brain functions, supporting the immune system and healing after injury or disease, and protecting against heart disease and diabetes.Sleep can be affected by our body health conditions. Many sleep disorders happened due to many body health issues like, insufficient nutrition, restless activities, mental state and many more.However, before the prediction can be made whether health can predict sleep, this dataset needs to be pre-processed before it can be fed into AI prediction model. Pre-process the Health_Sleep.csv dataset with Python programming on Google Colab. Each question below required your code.2. Loading dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. (1 mark)3. Find the following information: (3 marks)a. Number of rows and columns (list all columns)b. Find the basic statistics of all columnc. Find out the data type for each column4. Handle missing values (2 marks)a) Find number of missing values from each attributeb) Do imputation in any missing values. Explain how you replace the missing values.5. Perform. encoding for any appropriate columns. Explain why you need it and how you do it.  (2 marks)6. If you are using Simple Linear Regression, identify which one is your dependent variable and independent variable. Write the code and justify your answer. Fit the SLR with the variables you have chosen. (3 marks)
